// Dispatch Queues

// and timers and it dispatches those things for execution to a pool of virtual
// processors. Virtual processors are automatically acquired and relinquished

// A dispatch queue has a minimum, maximum and current concurrency. The minimum
// concurrency is currently always 0, while the maximum concurrency is the
// maximum number of virtual processors that the queue is allowed to acquire and
// maintain at any given time. The current concurrency is the number of virtual
// processors the queue is currently actively maintaining.
// A dispatch queue with a maximum concurrency number of 1 is also knows as a
// serial dispatch queue because all work items and timers are dispatched one
// after the other. No two of them will ever execute in parallel on such a queue.
// A dispatch queue with a maximum concurrency of > 1 is also known as a concurrent
// queue because the queue is able to execute multiple work items and timers in
// parallel.
// The minimum concurrency level should typically be 0. The queue automatically
// acquires virtual processors as needed. However it may make sense to pass a
// number > 0 to this argument to ensure that the queue will always have at least
// this number of virtual processors available. Eg to ensure a certain minimum
// latency from when a work item is scheduled to when it executes.
