extern void main_closure(int argc, char *argv[]);

// Apollo style process start function. Differences to the standard C start are:
// - invokes main_closure() instead of main().
// - it does not invoke exit() when main_closure() returns.
//
// A process in Apollo is a collection of dispatch queues rather than threads.
// Every process starts out with one dispatch queue which is known as the main
// dispatch queue. This is a serial dispatch queue which means that it executes
// one closure after the closures. Closures are dispatched to dispatch queues
// and the queue executes them as soon as possible. The main_closure() function
// is the first closure that is executed on the main dispatch queue of the
// process. This closure typically takes care of initializing the application
// and it then dispatches one or more other closures for execution on the main
// dispatch queue. Consequently this start function here does not terminate the
// process when main_closure() returns. Once the process is ready to terminate,
// one of its closures should invoke exit() with a suitable exit code.
