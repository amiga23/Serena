        // and learn an important lesson in life: types which are going to be used 
        // with math operations, like minus should never, ever be unsigned.
        // Why?
        // Because it makes it really easy to end up with accidental wrap arounds
        // if the lhs is smaller than the rhs. That's why you are then forced to
        // sprinkle your code with these extra tests to catch these cases before
        // they blow up in our face.
        // An unsigned integral type should only ever be used to represent bit
        // sets aka masks. But never anything that we are going to use to do
        // run-of-the-mill math with.
        // You'd think that after about 50 to 60 years people would have figured
        // that out. But, nope. Too obvious a way to stick a bug into your code
        // that then causes security issues and we all just love those, right?
